Lord i got myself on the pardon board
You know i got denied again
Been on the board three times
Each time i was denied
But i hope in the good lord
Lord have mercy on me

They tellin' me the governor was on the board
All around the board looking at them peter's case
Lord they must have passed mine around and
Because they denied me again
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy on me
I've been tryin', i've been tryin', lord every day of my life
Please lord have mercy on me

Says i worried, then i worried
They would give me some kind of chance
Please please lord give 'em hearts (?) the people round the pardon board
And lord let 'em feel my sorry too
Lord have mercy on me
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm...

I fell down on my knee
I prayed, i prayed both night and day
Hoping they would help me lord
Oh lord have mercy on my dying soul
Oh lord oh lord

Well i know my cases ain't too bad lord
I just can't see, just can't see why they did me this way
Lord have mercy on my dying soul
I got, i got a big family on my hands
They's out there in that free world waiting on me to reappear
Oh lord they want me to return again back to my home
Oh lord have mercy on me

I got a man told me that he would write
Now a letter to the governor for me
And i hope he would help me lord
Praying to the lord he hear my prayer
I wish that governor would take sides with me
Oh lord have mercy on me

This all i got to say
To you today
Please help me lord
In the name of god
