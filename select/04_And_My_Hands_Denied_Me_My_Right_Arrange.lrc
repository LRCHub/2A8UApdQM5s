[00:21.72] I feel the weight again of a pull that tries my head
[00:32.58] I know that i could try but i bend and bend and bend
[00:42.58] I hear your screams at night through the halls of my new home
[00:53.30] I could move a thousand miles away but you'd follow me along
[01:23.30] 
[01:55.74] I feel that the earth and the ground and life
[01:59.30] That i hold could drift out of my hands
[02:06.57] To become an abyss that could swallow me whole
[02:10.17] If i don't understand why it is
