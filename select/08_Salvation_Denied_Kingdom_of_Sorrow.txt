If you had a heart
I'd rip it out and show you it's black
Like this hole in my chest
If you had a soul
I'd twist it in knots
Exposing the leeches
That fester and rot
I've never cut deeper
Salvation

I've never bled longer
Denied
I'm dead on your altar
Salvation
Part of the slaughter
Denied

So much our lives wasted in misery
Cowering, cornered, bowing in apathy
Filled up with bitterness, no answers given
Condemned to nothingness, punishment granted

I've never cut deeper
Salvation
I've never bled longer
Denied
I'm dead on your altar
Salvation
Part of the slaughter
Denied

Your wasted life was a selfish choice
Your divisive words are now a silenced voice
I'm pitiless now, can't stand to think
Of the countless times you questioned me

I've never cut deeper
Salvation
I've never bled longer
Denied
I'm dead on your altar
Salvation
Part of the slaughter
Denied
(Breakdown)
Salvation Denied
(Breakdown continues)
(The End)
